I developed a simple Shiny app that provides an interactive analysis of the Top 5 European Leagues, allowing users to explore key football statistics for different teams.

# Features of the App:
League and Season Selection: Users can choose a league and season to analyze.
Total Goals per Team: A bar chart displaying the total goals scored by each team in the selected league.
Average Goals per Game: A bar chart showing the average goals per match for each team.
Goals vs. Expected Goals (xG): A scatter plot comparing actual goals scored with expected goals (xG) to identify overperforming and underperforming teams.
Yellow and Red Card Relationship: A scatter plot analyzing the correlation between yellow and red cards for teams in the league.
The app enables football enthusiasts and analysts to explore team performance trends visually and interactively.
